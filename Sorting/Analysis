## Bubble Sort
Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Time Complexity : n^2
Space Complexity : 1 , no extra space is used

Bubble sort is efficient when input is already sorted. 
It can be used when space is a concern.
But when array is long, bubble sort takes a lot of time to do sorting

## Selection Sort
